  <h1> Patterns using reaction-diffusion !! </h1>
  <p> Morphogenesis (the origin of form) has been the biggest fascination of developmental biologists for over a century!  One of the major breakthroughs to explain  morphogenesis came from Alan Turing, who proposed that complex patterns could be formed by reaction-diffusion mechanisms of chemical species. Here's a simulation with just 2 chemical species. Species A is auto-catalytic and also activates species B. B inhibits A.</p>
  <p> You can play around with the parameters to observe different patterns. It will take about 30s to notice anything interesting. </p>
